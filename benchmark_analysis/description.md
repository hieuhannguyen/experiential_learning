# Benchmarking Experiential Learning in Higher Business Education
## Hannah Nguyen, advised by Kathleen Conway - Tepper School of Business

### Introduction
This project aims at defining a benchmark for measuring an institution's adoption of experiential learning (EL) in their practices. There exists no public dataset on the kinds of EL activities schools organized. Moreover, the definition of EL is not concrete but rather adaptable across schools. In deriving a model that identifies the scale of which a school promotes and adopts EL activities then uses Python for analysis, I address the previous issues and provide the Tepper School of Business with an understanding of where it stands amongst competitors.

Please see this [link](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tepperel/home) for more details on the analysis schema. This github page only contains the data analysis part of this much larger research.

### Data Sources
Data was manually extracted from a list of business schools' official websites. The data is then stored in a .csv [file](https://github.com/hieuhannguyen/experiential_learning/blob/main/elprograms.csv) for analysis.

### Results
Some major conclusions include:
- Project-based courses are the most popular EL programs offered for both business undergraduate and MBA students.
- MBA students have more access to student investment funds, service opportunities, field work, and industry labs.
- Among 9 schools of the top 10 business programs, two-thirds offer project-based courses and global internships. More than half offer service-learning programs.

Moreover, as a result of this work, Tepper now has an official site with a definition for experiential learning: https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/undergraduate-programs/experiential-learning.html
