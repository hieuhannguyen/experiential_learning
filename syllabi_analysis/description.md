# Extracting Experiential Learning Adoption in Academic Courses through Syllabi
## Hannah Nguyen, advised by Kathleen Conway - Tepper School of Business

### Introduction
In this project, I collected Tepper syllabi from Spring 2022 to Fall 2024 to understand how instructors perceive and adopt experiential learning in the classroom. I follow Tepper's official definition of experiential learning, posted on the school's official website: https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/undergraduate-programs/experiential-learning.html 

My data analysis answered the following questions:
1. What are trends among classes that submit a syllabus over the years? What percentage of the total number of classes? How does this percentage look if we group by "Semester Offer"?
2. What are the different types of assessment instructors typically issue in classes? Among these types, which classes are more likely to issue one assessment over others?
3. Are there classes that mention experiential learning? How about reflection? Are there classes that mention a client project?

The third question allows me to isolate the dataset into a few classes that might be relevant for Tepper to highlight and include in their experiential learning dashboard. I went through these classes manually to filter out those that closely follow the school's definition and those that do not.

### Data Sources
The syllabi dataset is collected from Carnegie Mellon University's internal canvas site. The syllabi were converted into PDFs and uploaded to the project's Google Drive folder. The data is not included on github, but a copy of the analysis & scraping notebooks and working report is included.

### Results
Some major insights include:
- Around 60% of all Tepper courses have their syllabi available on the internal canvas site (this is encouraged by the school to ensure students have information about the course before taking it). Among these courses, resubmission rates are high, especially among classes that are offered in the Fall and in both semesters. In other words, if a professor submits their syllabus to the internal canvas site, they will continue to do so in the following semesters.
- Tepper professors are supportive of applied learning but the most common assessment types are still exams and case studies, typical for a business school. Moreover, while there are many projects, almost none include a real client where students can apply learning in a high-stake scenario, indicative of the official EL definition.
