# Data Collection and Analysis: Experiential Learning in Business Higher Education
## A Self-Led Research and Analysis Project
### Abstract
I worked on this simple project for Tepper School of Business, collecting data on experiential learning programs and providing an analysis using Python. This is part of a larger research to benchmark experiential learning that I did for Tepper -> [link](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tepperel/home)
### Learning Reflection
I faced many challenges with the data mainly because there exists no relevant dataset I could pull from, so I set out to collect the data on my own. I was eager to apply my learning in Data Analysis & Visualization to this project, and while there is so much more I could have done if I had more data, I was proud of my initiative and application of the NLTK package.
### Data Sources
I collected the data on my own by manually extracting relevant information from the schools' websites. The data is then stored in a .csv [file](https://github.com/hieuhannguyen/experiential_learning/blob/main/elprograms.csv) for analysis.
