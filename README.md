# Projects with the Tepper School of Business
## Hannah Nguyen, Undergraduate Programs Assistant

### Introduction
As the Undergraduate Programs Assistant, I led research projects to inform Tepper leadership on the school's experiential learning initiatives. I completed two major projects:
- Benchmarking experiential learning in higher business education (`benchmark_analysis` folder)
- Analyzing Tepper syllabi for experiential learning implementationg(`syllabi_analysis` folder)

A brief description is included in each folder. This github page only stores code files and not the full report for each project. The skills I demonstrated include cleaning and visualizing data, unstructured strategies with NLTK & Spacy, and plotting data using seaborn and matplotlib.
